## 📝 Project Description
As part of the **World Data Championship 2026**, this project evaluates the urban performance of **Briarport** against 11 regional peer cities from 2015 to 2024. 

Instead of a generic report, I built a **Strategic Diagnostic Tool** designed to help city planners navigate a critical paradox: Briarport offers excellent cost of living but suffers from deteriorating infrastructure.

### 🎯 Key Objectives:
1.  **Benchmarking:** Compare Briarport across 5 key metrics (Housing, Transit, Emissions, Green Space, Livability).
2.  **Gap Analysis:** Quantify the exact variance between Briarport and the regional average.
3.  **Strategy:** Develop a data-driven roadmap to improve the city's livability ranking.

## 💡 Key Insights & The "Paradox"

The analysis revealed a sharp strategic trade-off:

* ✅ **The Competitive Advantage:** Briarport is the regional leader in **Housing Affordability** (Index: **24.58**) and Environmental Quality. The city is significantly cheaper and cleaner than the peer average.
* ⚠️ **The Bottleneck:** This advantage is threatened by a critical decline in **Transit Connectivity** (Score: **65.04**), trailing far behind top-tier cities like Ironbar.
* **Conclusion:** The city is growing outwards (Sprawl) rather than efficiently.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Modeling & DAX
* **Variance Analysis:** Created dynamic measures to calculate the gap between Briarport and the Peer Average.
* **Dynamic Formatting:** Used DAX logic to apply conditional formatting based on metric type (e.g., *Lower is Better* for Housing, *Higher is Better* for Transit).
